    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What could possibly be so unnatural that God himself would not ordain such a thing to happen in nature. 
        Only human arrogance and greed could produce a total abomination to the processes of natural selection
        and evolution. Yes, we are talking about the favorite treat of all cats, including Checkers--Tuna. 
        Specifically, tuna sandwiches. Spending its entire life in the ocean until pulled from the depths by 
        hunters with great nets, the average adult tuna weighs in at about 60 pounds. However, the largest
        specimens have been known to eclipse 400 pounds. Even an average tuna could eat a 10 pound orange tabby
        for a light afternoon snack, possibly with room for wine and a cigarette.</p>
    <p>This is an average tuna sandwich with white bread.</p>
