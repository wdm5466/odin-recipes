    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Back in Missouri, Checkers was a strapping young kitty cat at the time. Since his parents were on a shoe string budget, one of their
        go to meals was spaghetti and meat balls. Since Checkers was so young and full of energy, he could jump on many household surfaces
        and reach places the dog generally couldn't. One of Checkers' favorite places to investigate was the stove at dinner time. On more
        than one occasion, his humans turned their backs for a second only to find Checkers had stuffed his entire face into a fresh pot of
        red sauce, spaghetti, and meat balls.</p>
    <p>This recipe is a basic spaghetti with beef meat balls and red sauce. A Checkers specialty. Yum!</p>
